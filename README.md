MinecraftLogFormatter
=====================

A simple cli created to compile Minecraft-serverlogs into HTML-files.

The featured functionality is the input of a logfile, chosen via parameter or user input,
parse its lines, convert special characters and add color-tags for "WARN" and "INFO".
Then HTML-files containing up to 100 lines each will be written, these should also contain
links to the next and previous site.
